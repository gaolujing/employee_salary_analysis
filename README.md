# employee_salary_analysis
This sql project is an attempt to uncover insights about a company's employee and salary using a synthetic database.

The specific questions explored in this project are: 
a. what is the breakdown of male and female employees from 1990 to 2002? 
b. how did the average salaries for male and female employees change over time?
c. how many male and female managers each department has from 1990 to 2002?

The sql script for the queries and the result datasets are uploaded here. The visualization of the query results are published on my tableau public: https://public.tableau.com/profile/lujing.gao#!/vizhome/BreakdownofEmployeesbyGender1990-2002/Dashboard1
